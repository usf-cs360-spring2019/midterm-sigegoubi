        <h3>Caption</h3>
        <p>
          The above is a heat map that visualize the response time among all <em> Battalion </em> in San
          Francisco except B99. The vertical axis represents each <em> Battalion </em> in order, and the
          horizontal axis shows the hour of the day. In addition, the color encoding the average response
          time in each small block, and the color legend is also included in the Prototype within range through
          0 minute to 15 minutes.
        </p>
        <h3>Interpretation</h3>
        <p>
          In this heatmap, we can see the average response time during day time for each <em> Battalion </em>
          is pretty similar. However, during midnight, we can see some outliers pop up. We can see <em> Battalion </em>
          B03 AND B09 encountered long response time cases during midnight. As a result, the reason behind this fact
          indicated in the heatmap needs further investigation.

        <h3>Caption</h3>
        <p>
          This bubble chart represents how fast San Francisco Fire Department responses. The efficieny is measured by two different time ranges in x, y axis correspondly, which are 1) time difference between Dispatch time and Received time, 2) time difference between Dispatch time and On Scene time. Each bubble represents a different region in San Francisco, with 41 regions in total. The color of the bubble chart represents the location measured by the continuous variable, Latitude, from South to North. At the same time, each bubble in the chart indicates the count of incidents in each region. This prototype will be interactive when the D3 version is done. To be specific, when the user move the mouse to different bubble, more detail informaiton, for example the name of the region, will be shown.
        </p>
        <h3>Interpretation</h3>
        <p>
          From the x-axis, we see that the time from the call received at the 911 Dispatch Center to 911 operator dispatches this unit to the call is mostly from 120 seconds to 160 seconds, which is 2 minutes to ~5.3 minutes. This is a reasonable and normal response time. From the y-axis, we can see that the time from the unit records arriving to the location of the incident to the time 911 operator dispatches this unit to the call is mostly from 350 seconds to 480 seconds, which is 5.8 minutes to 8 minutes. And measured by two different range of time, we can see the responding time are normal for the most resgions in San Francisco.
